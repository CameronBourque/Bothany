## Help
### Commands:
/help: Display this message.
/sound: Manages what sounds to associate with roles. When someone joins a voice channel with a role configured with a sound. I will play the sound. These can also be removed. I only support mp3, ogg, and webm files. If you change the name of the role I will update that for you. If you delete the role and recreate it then you will have to re-add the sound. 
/welcome_message: Manages how I introduce new people to the server. This defaults to not being set, meaning I won\'t say anything when someone new joins. If you set this and don\'t want it, then you can remove it so I stop introducing new members.
/kick_word: Manages a list of terms that can get a user kicked from the server. Terms can be added or removed. They are case insensitive ("A" is the same as "a").

### Permission Needs:
View Channels: This is required for everything
Kick Members: Used to kick members violating the list of kickable words
Connect: So I can play sounds
Speak: So I can play sounds
Use Voice Activity: So I can play sounds
